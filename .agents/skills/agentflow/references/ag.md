# Agentflow pipeline

Use this file only after the devlog protocol and adjacent `ag.json` are validated. The pipeline turns a behavior wish into requirements, a current repository map when justified, a specification, isolated implementation, and independent acceptance. Keep workflow detail out of owner-facing prose unless needed.

Rule-editing guard: `— I-NNN` marks a rule born from a real failure. Read its narrative in `docs/incidents-log.md` before changing or removing it.

## Front door and route

Read `references/delegation.md` before selecting or dispatching an executor; it owns frozen-brief transport, confinement, profiles, watchdog, attempts, and acceptance. For evaluation-harness work, read `eval/evaluation-harness.md` before evaluation-harness work.

Read and validate adjacent `ag.json`, STATUS, the latest unfinished Ask, Git state, and exact current artifacts before choosing work. Record one route: `direct`, `selected_advisors`, `full_pipeline`, or `blocked`, naming operation, `allow-ag`, material risks, named questions, owner confirmation, and plain-language reason. `$target_doc` is the owner conversation and live recovery surface; STATUS is recovery projection, not settings storage.

- `direct`: clear local reversible work whose files, focused test, and final relevant suite are identifiable.
- `selected_advisors`: each named advisor answers an important question that direct work cannot settle; naming a stage without stating its question is insufficient.
- `full_pipeline`: expensive-to-reverse behavior, important trust/subsystem boundary, serious hidden-test risk, or enabled explicit trigger.
- `blocked`: an `allow-ag`/owner decision, unavailable confinement, missing evidence, exhausted attempts, or other hard stop prevents work.

`allow-ag: on` permits selected/full routes; `off` blocks them before Agentflow and never silently downgrades; `ask` requires recorded owner approval for complex pipeline jobs. A simple job can use the direct planning route under every setting. A route trigger is not a settings change and never overrides `off`; only a separate validated `allow-ag: on` change can enable a later complex pipeline route.

Direct work needs no approval. Explicit `ag`, `agentflow`, and `all-in` force full pipeline when allowed. `make-plans` classifies each job as simple or complex, publishes self-contained simple plans directly, retains the accepted requirements/specification gate for complex plans, names blocked complex jobs, and stops after frozen queue publication.

The exact owner trigger `3ways` or `threeways` is the narrow exception: it permits one read-only pre-implementation `threeways` review through the unified runner even when `allow-ag` is off. It neither enables a pipeline nor authorizes implementation. The host records its immutable debate artifacts, consensus or unresolved state, and the later human Design Go or Stop boundary.

Before calling `plan_jobs`, the natural-language host inspects the owner request and relevant repository evidence for each job and supplies `complexity_reasons`: a unique list containing only applicable reasons from `material_uncertainty`, `cross_subsystem_coordination`, `public_or_stored_data_contract`, `trust_boundary`, and `unresolved_material_decision`. Empty routes directly as simple; non-empty routes through the complex pipeline. The owner supplies the work request, not a route, and job length is never used. For execution, looper uses `select_frozen_ready_plans`, and an ordinary host uses `select_host_ready_plans`; both names refer to the exact same function object.

## Pipeline stages and codewalk gate

The canonical durable `pipeline-roles` names are `requirements`, `codewalk`, `explore`, `spike`, `spec`, `implementation`, `security-scan`, `acceptance`, `cross-check`, and `learn`; each is a configured tier or `off`. `cross-check` selects the external worker tier for the separate post-implementation gate and is not added to the full-pipeline stage order. Per-request `advisors:` remains a validated fixed roster and narrows/overrides durable defaults for that Ask.

Its selection is frozen in the brief/run record, survives recovery and amendments, and never widens because context was lost. `all-in` runs every optional advisor and forbids scaled-down mandatory stages for that Ask.

Full pipeline order is requirements, existing-repository discovery, codewalk when triggered, applicable explore/spike, specification, implementation, security review, acceptance, and applicable learn. Requirements, specification, implementation, and acceptance are mandatory: if their durable setting is `off`, validation warns that the full pipeline is unavailable; never claim a complete pipeline. Codewalk, explore, spike, security-scan, and learn may be skipped only with recorded evidence and the configured/route reason.

When the Ask contains `cross-check`, apply it to the final implementation result, not to each pipeline stage. Mandatory external acceptance may serve as the one cross-check only when its report covers the same final implementation commit and satisfies the cross-check report contract in `SKILL.md`; otherwise dispatch one external read-only reviewer after implementation. Requirements, codewalk, explore, spike, specification, security, acceptance, and learn do not each receive another cross-check.

For an existing repository, discovery is recorded. Codewalk is required only when at least one trigger is true: unfamiliar code, multiple subsystems, public interface, stored data, trust boundary, or stale/missing map. With a trigger, one accepted current codewalk record can satisfy both logical obligations only when it has an explicit shared-coverage marker, current codewalk evidence, answered questions, and the required discovery facts: verified paths, fact/inference labels, public boundaries, conventions, likely edit locations, focused commands, and unexamined areas.

Without a trigger, retain the small discovery record and do not dispatch codewalk. The codewalk advisor starts at the named surface, reads necessary context only, and does not run commands by default; later work refreshes only affected parts.

The four evidence-trigger answers are recorded in a devlog RUN event before run/skip: explore — material risk or uncertainty remains after requirements/discovery; spike — one named technical question needs observed evidence before specification; security-scan — security/trust boundary is touched or requested; learn — a real lesson, error, surprise, workaround, or recommendation occurred. Skip only with concrete evidence for “no”; uncertainty runs the advisor or asks the owner. `all-in` answers every trigger “run”. Mandatory advisors may scale depth but still produce their artifact; every selected/run advisor is fresh external work, not coordinator authorship, and acceptance is never coordinator-authored.

After the pipeline is selected, one final route check may move a trivial, unambiguous, mechanical request back to direct work. Record that change as a devlog question with a suggested default, use one brief, let the coordinator verify the result, and create no artifact directory. `$auto_reply_mode=on` may accept the safe default; `all-in` disables this shortcut.

## Queue, artifacts, and live events

Decomposition runs `tracker-contract.js template` and fills that exact output as `<work-root>/tracker.md` before dependent work. Validate it before each checked checkpoint. Refresh it after scope changes, milestones, checkpoints, and before long work or completion; continue after writing. It supplements the devlog and never replaces queue or looper authority.

`make-plans` freezes simple jobs directly and freezes complex jobs only after accepted requirements/specification and no unresolved material choice. Publish candidate plan bytes privately, move without overwrite, and publish `.queue-generation.json` last. Schema-v2 envelopes bind each simple plan to its owner request and repository evidence, each complex plan to the accepted contract, and the final integration plan to every published route authority.

A denied mixed request may publish only an independent simple-only queue whose final integration claim excludes blocked work. Check open/completed names and queue collisions before staging. Plans gain authority only when the envelope exists and digests match; make-plans never starts implementation.

Allocate one work root at `$workspace_dir/artifacts/<work-key>/`, or `$workspace_dir/features/<taskkey>/artifacts/<work-key>/` in a stream. Keep all new files there; planned files belong in that root's `planned/`. New prompts/reports use paired `*-brief.md`/`*-report.md` names, with `implementation-brief.md`/`implementation-report.md` and `spikes/<question-key>-brief.md`/`-report.md` as specified.

Existing allocated paths remain authoritative. Record raw branch identity because the root path no longer names it; use the smallest numeric suffix on a collision.

Every artifact opens with one fresh Taipei stamp `* _YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (<model>/<effort>)_` and ends with exactly one final `Self-check:` content line. The artifact gate checks path, size, freshness, boundaries, and verified generation reference; trailing newline is allowed. A syntactically valid model or effort that differs from trusted dispatch metadata produces a warning and never triggers a paid retry. Create no placeholders. Commit a canonical artifact before replacing it and keep artifacts and branch markers tracked.

Append numbered RUN events to `$target_doc` after material transitions. Each event has a fresh Taipei timestamp, declares its Ask, and records one or more short facts. Record routes, dispatch identities, gates, results, answers, substitutions, failures, relaunches, deviations, and scope checks. Launches are recorded before start, results after collection, and gates before dependent work. WIP remains the complete ten-minute owner status and does not repeat the event trail.

Before each checkpoint or Reply, reconcile live handles, commits, gates, the tracker, and the current devlog events. Late repairs name the missing span. Noncompleted results include status, exit or signal, timeout, launch error, and up to 4,096 output bytes; absent values are `none`. Historical runlog files remain untouched and are not current evidence. — I-017/I-057.

Round compaction is a protocol operation: copy complete older physical Ask spans unchanged into the one adjacent `<basename>.archive.md` in chronological order, verify identifier, byte length, and SHA-256 before removing the same live bytes, and preserve every verified copy on interruption or uncertainty. `Archived eras:` points only to that adjacent path or `none`; it never contains labels, ranges, batches, or an index. Keep the current round below STATUS and the next empty Ask scaffold at the end, and write the Reply before the final STATUS projection.

## Gates and evidence

Keep dependencies current and rerun only affected evidence: owner decisions invalidate dependent exploration/spec/implementation/security/acceptance; changed brownfield surfaces invalidate codewalk/spec assumptions; exploration/spikes invalidate affected spec; changed spec invalidates implementation and post-implementation reports; changed implementation invalidates security/acceptance; late requirements require spec refresh.

Worker findings do not change the accepted scope. Before a finding becomes a requirement, invariant, repair, test, or implementation change, the coordinator records the exact owner-request sentence or existing standing obligation that requires that observable behavior. Without that trace, reject the finding or park it as a proposal. Reviewer severity and hypothetical failure paths are evidence to consider, not authority to expand the product. — I-054.

Requirements and specification each have a sign-off gate before coding. With `auto-reply: off`, point only to the exact requirements report and open IDs in the devlog; owner answers go in one empty `- ans:` field per question and still require devlog sign-off. With `on`, only safe routine defaults receive explicit same-pass provenance; owner-only, conflicting, failed, missing, or hard-stop decisions remain open. The spec gate verifies each `R-<n>` coverage ledger maps to its section and `INV-<n>` IDs.

Security is one defensive pass over declared changed files and trust boundaries. A moderation refusal is an executor error, not a clean scan; retry once with equivalent defensive wording. The owner or coordinator must decide how to handle findings about data loss, destructive behavior, exposed credentials, or failure of the behavior the owner explicitly requested; record other findings as follow-up work.

Acceptance first marks every `R-<n>` as covered, missing, or not proven, then rechecks each `INV-<n>` with real commands, keeping behavior separate from record quality. Missing evidence remains not proven. Neither stage starts an automatic repair loop.

Formal repair is coordinator-only and limited to a fixed stamp, heading, path label, or final boundary from immutable authority/verified evidence; record before/after identities, span, and unchanged outside bytes, then rerun the gate. Substantive defects return to the responsible stage. Review stages keep one identity, preflight working directory/test/executable/authentication, and at most three total starts; one preflight failure before process/model start is free, all post-start failures count, and unavailable facts are `SKIP`.

## External implementation handoff

Use delegation's frozen-brief, write-authority, and delivered-checkout verification rules. The worker stops and asks the master on any unclear, contradictory, wrong, or missing requirement/specification. It uses narrow vertical slices, red-first tests, same-commit regression tests, focused checks, declared verification, and invariant IDs; it preserves user changes and writes only its report/result.

Use configured `better` for requirements, codewalk, explore, spike, and spec; `best` for security-scan; `basic` for implementation; and `better` for acceptance, preferably a different family. Apply owner overrides exactly; an unavailable coordinator-selected model may use the nearest tier with a recorded substitution, but an unavailable owner override pauses. Never launch when write authority cannot be enforced.

Claim completion only when required artifacts exist, acceptance covers every requirement and satisfies every invariant, relevant security evidence is current, declared checks pass, and Git state supports the claim. Material claims cite coordinator-read or coordinator-executed evidence; worker text alone cannot prove identity, timing, transport, or acceptance.
