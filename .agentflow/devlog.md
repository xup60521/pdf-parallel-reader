## [RUN-001] Event (during round A-001)

- Route: direct.
- Initialized Agentflow records and confirmed the repository is on `main`.
- Intake initially failed under Node because the project?s ESM package mode conflicts with the bundled CommonJS scripts; reran the same local scripts with Bun successfully.
- Scope: Agentflow initialization only; no application source changes requested.

## [RUN-002] Event (during round A-001)

- Complete relevant suite: `bun run check` passed with Biome checking 18 files and no fixes.
- Cross-check plan: targeted, based on the frozen four-file initialization scope and 95 changed lines.
- Frozen implementation scope: `.agentflow/devlog.md`, `.gitignore`, `ag.json`, and `.agentflow/cross-check-facts.json`; pre-existing untracked Agentflow skill files remain outside this unit.
- Next gate: commit this initialization unit, then dispatch the required read-only cross-check.
